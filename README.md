# Lane Keeper & Obstacle Avoidance Car (AVR Based)

## üìå Project Overview
This repository contains an **AVR-based autonomous car** that can **keep itself within a lane** and **avoid obstacles**.  
The system is implemented around the **ATmega32A** microcontroller and was developed as the final project for the Embedded Systems Diploma at **Telecom Egypt Training Sector**.

Key capabilities:
- **Lane Keeping** using IR sensors to detect lane markings  
- **Obstacle Avoidance** using ultrasonic sensors to detect and react to objects  
- Smooth motor control with H-bridge driver for navigation
